## Introduction
For my final project, I aim to develop an application dedicated to addressing
the issue of global food waste within individual households. The United Nations
reports that 50% of all fruits and vegetables produced worldwide are wasted
annually. In Toronto, over half of the food waste in single-family households is
avoidable, including leftovers and untouched food. Motivated by these findings,
my project will focus on aiding individuals in reducing food waste through
enhanced planning and utilization of their purchased items.

## Technologies & Methodologies
The application will be designed to assist users in more effectively planning
their grocery shopping. Several techniques we learnt from the course will be applied:
1. # Web Crawling from Trader Joes and Storing the Data into Postgres Database
    - To obtain the real time price and foods for users to plan grocery shopping
2. # Data Storage with Python
    - Incorporating a grocery shopping list for users to keep track of the items
3. # AI Generated Receipe
    - To provide user a cooking inspiration to avoid food waste
