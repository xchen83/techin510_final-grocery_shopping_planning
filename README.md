## Introduction
For my final project, I aim to develop an application dedicated to addressing
the issue of global food waste within individual households. The United Nations
reports that 50% of all fruits and vegetables produced worldwide are wasted
annually. In Toronto, over half of the food waste in single-family households is
avoidable, including leftovers and untouched food. Motivated by these findings,
my project will focus on aiding individuals in reducing food waste through
enhanced planning and utilization of their purchased items.

## Technologies & Methodologies
The application will be designed to assist users in more effectively planning
their grocery shopping. Leveraging the skills acquired in Lab 3, I plan to create a
grocery shopping list application. Additionally, I aim to integrate a web scraping
tool, as introduced in Lab 2, to gather information on grocery items and their
prices, aiding users in planning their shopping more efficiently. Lastly, I intend to
connect the application's data to a Postgres database to ensure real-time data
availability.
